# Problem 4: Print the pattern in a simple way

n = 5  # because last row has 5 letters (A to E)

for i in range(n, 0, -1):          # loop from 5 down to 1
    for j in range(1, i + 1):      # loop from 1 to current row length
        print(chr(64 + j), end=" ")  # convert number to letter (65 -> 'A')
    print()  # move to next line


output:
A B C D E
A B C D
A B C
A B
A
